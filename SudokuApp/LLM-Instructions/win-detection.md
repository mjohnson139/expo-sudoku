Win detection & end‑game UI

      – Watch for the board matching the solution, then show a
    “congratulations” dialog or animation.

### Implementation Steps for Win Detection

1. Store the complete solved grid when a new puzzle is generated.
2. After each user input (cell value change), run a check:
   - Compare the current board state to the stored solution grid.
   - Optionally, bail early if any cell is empty or incorrect.
3. If all cells match:
   - Emit a “win” event in your game state or context.
4. Listen for the “win” event in your UI component:
   - Show a congratulations dialog or animation.
   - Disable further cell edits.
5. (Optional) Offer buttons to start a new game or review the solution.
