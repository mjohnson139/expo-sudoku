I'm ready to help you build your Sudoku app. When you provide specific requirements, I can assist with:

Setting up the game board UI with React Native components
Implementing game logic (puzzle generation, validation, solving)
Creating user interactions (number input, hints, difficulty levels)
Adding features like timers, score tracking, or difficulty settings
Just let me know what part of the Sudoku app you'd like to work on first, and I'll provide the relevant code and guidance.
