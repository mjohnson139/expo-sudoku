This is an Expo/React‑Native Sudoku game with:

    • Puzzle‑generation & solution via the sudoku‑gen library
    • A 9×9 Grid component that:
      – Renders each cell, handles selection, highlights
    row/col/box/same‑value relations
      – Supports “notes” mode (pencil‐in small candidate numbers)
      – Supports “feedback” mode (mark correct vs. incorrect entries)
      – Applies customizable themes (classic, dark, pastel, etc.)
    • A NumberPad component for entering digits or toggling notes
    • A simple menu to pick difficulty (easy/medium/hard/expert) and
    start/reset a game
    • A BuildNotes modal for release‐notes / version info

    What’s missing / good next tasks:

    • Win detection & end‑game UI (DONE)
      – Watch for the board matching the solution, then show a
    “congratulations” dialog or animation.
    • Timer / stopwatch
      – Display elapsed solve time; pause/continue when app goes
    background.
    • Hint button
      – Fill one correct cell on demand (and potentially track hint‑usage).
    • Persisting game state
      – Save in AsyncStorage so players can resume after closing the app.
    • Undo/redo (DONE)
      – Maintain a history stack for cell changes and notes.
    • Stats / Leaderboard
      – Track best times by difficulty, number of mistakes, etc.

    Any of these would be a natural next feature to polish out your Sudoku
    experience.
