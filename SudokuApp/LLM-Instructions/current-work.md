# Current work in progress

- Automating the Testing of the app via MCP:ios-simulator-mcp tool.
    - You must use `screen-testing.md` for the instructions to use the tool.  Offsets are required for reliable taps.  
    - Goal: Create reliable scripts that an LLM can use to Navigate the app.  
    - Properly markup UI with Accessiblity features to allow for easy navigation of the UI.  
    - Provide concise instructions for navigating the app. 
    - Provide adjustments to the navigation of the app for Timing of user interaction.  We want to move at the pace of a human, not a script. 
    Provide a way to string interactions together for smooth UI interaction.
