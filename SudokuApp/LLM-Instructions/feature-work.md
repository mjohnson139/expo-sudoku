# Current Feature Work
Add full AsyncStorage–based persistence so players can close and later resume their current puzzle:

    • Add dependency
      – Install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage (or expo’s
    equivalent)
      – Import AsyncStorage where needed

    • Create a storage helper (e.g. utils/storage.js)
      – export saveGameState(gameStateObj) → AsyncStorage.setItem(…)
      – export loadGameState() → AsyncStorage.getItem(…) + JSON.parse
      – export clearGameState() → AsyncStorage.removeItem(…)

    • Define your persisted shape
      – board, solutionBoard, initialBoardState
      – cellNotes, cellFeedback
      – undoStack, redoStack (optional)
      – showFeedback, notesMode
      – maybe timestamp or version tag

    • On GameScreen mount
      – call loadGameState()
        – if result exists, allow user to “Resume Game”
        – otherwise show “New Game” menu only
      – if resuming, populate all matching state vars and hide menu

    • UI for resume vs new
      – In your menu modal, insert a “Resume last game” button when saved
    state found
      – Wire it to restore state and close the menu

    • Hook into state changes to persist
      – In effects watching board, cellNotes, undoStack, etc., call
    saveGameState(debounced)
      – Use a small debounce (200–500ms) so you’re not writing on every
    keystroke

    • Clear or migrate persisted state
      – When user starts a brand‑new game, call clearGameState() first
      – You may want to store a version key in the saved object to handle
    future migrations

    • Error handling & fallback
      – Wrap all AsyncStorage calls in try/catch
      – If parse error or version mismatch, clear storage and fall back to
    new game

    • Testing & verification
      – Close and restart the app to ensure resume works end‑to‑end
      – Test edge cases: partial entries, notes, undo/redo stacks
      – Verify that state resets on “New Game”
